# Furiously Curious

Welcome to the behind-the-scenes of Furiously Curious, a blog where complex topics meet simplicity.

## What's This All About?

Furiously Curious is my playground for exploring and explaining intricate concepts in a way that's accessible to everyone. My mission? To break down complex ideas into bite-sized, comprehensible pieces. After all, if you can't explain it to a 12-year-old, do you really understand it yourself?

## What You'll Find Here

This repo houses the Jekyll-powered blog where I dive into a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

- Software Engineering deep-dives
- Computer Science fundamentals
- Web Development tricks and tips
- The occasional culinary adventure or gardening insight

Recent explorations include:
- Demystifying binary numbers
- Understanding Instruction Set Architectures
- And coming soon: Debugging with DAP, implementing light/dark mode, and more!

## Tech Stack

While the blog uses a pre-built Jekyll theme (because content is king!), my posts often delve into:

- Ruby & Rails
- JavaScript & React
- CSS wizardry
- Low-level CS concepts

## Philosophy

My approach is simple:
1. Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler.
2. If a 12-year-old can't understand it, it needs more work.
3. Learning should be fun and interesting.
