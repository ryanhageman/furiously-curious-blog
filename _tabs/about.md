Ever since I was a kid, I’ve loved writing programs. I started my career as a Paramedic for 911 in New Orleans. After that, I moved up to work as a Flight Paramedic in the Caribbean. These days, I’m also a film and TV Paramedic working with studios like Marvel, Disney, Netflix, and Warner Bros. I’ve handled everything from hiring and scheduling to managing high-pressure situations on set.

While I loved the adrenaline and the chance to help people, I was ready for a change. I wanted a career that not only paid the bills but also sparked my passion for technology. That’s when I decided to dive into software engineering. What started as a quest for stability quickly turned into a rewarding journey in tech.

## What I Do

I build web applications and enjoy every part of the process. My main tools are Ruby on Rails and React. I do full-stack development with a side of DevOps, and design. I’ve worked on all sorts of projects, learning from different codebases and making complex systems easy to use.

I’ve also taught web development, sharing my knowledge of Rails, advanced Rails, and React with students eager to enter the tech world. I really like to help others build their skills and launch their careers.

## Highlights

- **UC Berkeley ERSO HR App**: I developed a comprehensive HR application all on my own. I worked directly with the client and their team to create a solution that made their workflows smoother and more efficient.

- **AI and Computer Vision with Grok & Banter**: My first developer role involved working with AI and computer vision. It was an exciting start and a great learning experience.

- **Tumor DNA Analysis Tools for Caris**: I helped redesign and build internal tools for a company that creates custom cancer treatments. The new tools made it easier to access and use critical data, improving the way they develop personalized treatments.

- **Teaching Web Development**: I’ve led courses in Rails, advanced Rails, and React. It’s been amazing to see students grow their skills and prepare for their tech careers.

## What’s Next

I’m all about creating innovative web applications and making tech work better for everyone. I’m looking for opportunities where I can use my skills in Ruby on Rails, React, and AI to solve real-world problems and build impactful solutions.
