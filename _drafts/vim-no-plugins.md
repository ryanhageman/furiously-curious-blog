title: Vim, No Plugins

Here's your work computer. It's a [fill in the blank] you can use [editor you'd never heard of] to write code. Only the preapproved plugins are allowed. Only software from our preapproved list may be installed. 

What can you do? You've never used that editor. There are no plugins that'll let you use anything close to your normal workflow.

Pretty much every computer comes with Vim, though.

I started with Sublime Text, then Atom, then VS Code. I learned the keymaps. I added the plugins. It was good. After a while, my pinky on my left hand was a smidge numb. Apparently this is called "Emacs Pinky" from all the Ctrl keymaps. I saw a video where the person was doing weird voodoo with text, making whole words and everything inside parentheses disappear and new text reappear. I wanted those powers. The [Learn Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vintharas.learn-vim) plugin in VS Code was my gateway drug. 

It was clunky for a while, but I left the mouse on, and I was in my editor with all my plugins. After a while, I couldn't live without Vim motions. And, my pinky wasn't numb anymore. I fiddled with Vim distributions, because it's OVERWHELMING trying to figure out what settings you actually need when building a Vim config from scratch. 

Ultimately, I settled on Doom Emacs. Yeah, Emacs. I like a gui with variable font sizes. It's nice.

New job. Windows computer. Nope, no Emacs. 

Here's WSL access, you've got a linux command line with sudo priveliges. It's a vm so you can install stuff that you need for development. 

Neovim!

I can figure this out. LunarVim was the distribution I chose. It was really nice and easy to get used to. I figured Neovim would always be an option. 

New job. Client computer. VS Code, but please don't install too many plugins. Gotta be careful, security. 

Oh, no Neovim.

VS Code with Vim motions is ok. You can customize VS Code settings, and if you want, toss a "plugin" in a special folder and customize some behavior with your own plugin.

Vim is there, though. It's a great option, but no plugins? No distributions? Only Vim and whatever you do yourself to set it up? 

Overwhelming.

Take it step by step, and it might not be as crazy as you'd think.
