title: Which Text Editor Should I Use?

People can get pretty intense about text editors. It makes sense, though, since it's one of the most important tools for developing software. That intensity can make it challenging to figure out which editor to choose. The options can feel overwhelming. They all ultimately do the same thing, but in a slightly different way. 

A different perspective can help. Instead of text editors, let's talk about chefs. Yeah, it's different, but is it? They slice and prep veggies, then combine them to make something delicious that the individual things couldn't be on their own. Software is diced and combined words and letters. 

## Learning to Cook

If a student goes to culinary school, they learn to cook in the school's kitchen. The knives and pans are organized how the school decides. It helps the student focus on the specifics they need to learn, instead of which drawer to put the peelers in. 

My software teachers suggested we use the same editor and color scheme as them when I first started writing code. It makes it so much easier to know what's going on when the colors on the screen and the keyboard shortcuts are the same as the teacher's.

## First Job

A chef's first job is in the restaurant's kitchen. Things are set up the way the restaurant's chef decides. While they might have their own knives and some preferences, they're working in the kitchen they're hired in, and things are where the folks before decided they should be. 

In the beginning it makes sense to work in a premade setup. While you do have some preferences, doing something a lot shows you what works in reality over theories and hypothesis about how things will be. It's good to have things set up for you and learn from the folks who came before you.

Most professional chefs work in their restaurant kitchen at work. Maybe they bring in their own set of knives, but for the most part, they use their employer's layout and tools. At home, they use the kitchen in their house, but it's the kitchen that came with their house. They bought some appliances and tools, but the layout stays how it came, designed by someone else.

Tools like Vim, Neovim,and Emacs come with built in functionality, but it's made to be minimal. You design the whole kitchen. You can buy appliances and tools (plugins) or you can create your own. It's a blank slate with a factory to create whatever you want.
